# ATTACK SWING ANIMATION

Attack/swing frame progression, read from left to right.
Each 3x3 area is one "frame" intended to be calculated + animated in the space
around a player character.

  Right-facing attack:
  XXX   XXX    XXX  XX/   X|X
  X@X   X@X    X@-  X@X   X@X
  X|X   XX\    XXX  XXX   XXX

  Down-facing attack:
  XXX   XXX    XXX  XXX   X|X
  X@-   X@X    X@X  X@X   -@X
  XXX   XX\    X|X  /XX   XXX

  Left-facing attack:
  XXX   XXX    XXX  \XX   X|X
  X@X   X@X    -@X  X@X   X@X
  X|X   /XX    XXX  XXX   XXX

  Up-facing attack:
  XXX   \XX    X|X  XX/   XXX
  -@X   X@X    X@X  X@X   X@-
  XXX   XXX    XXX  XXX   XXX

Implementation Note: 
This attack animation is intended to
represent a "swing" of a weapon that occurs in a 
3x3 square around the user. This square is the intended
"swing area" for the weapon swing.

If another player or a monster or environment is caught in
the part of the swing area containing the "blade" 
(the "|" or "\" or "-" or "/" character),
the respective entity should receive damage.

  Depending on the last arrow key used, the directional indicator
